fork of https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr
just follow the setup here https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr if ya want (preferably) then
poetry run vulnhuntr -h

the retry functionality has 10 tries so modify it if ya want (max_retries, main.py)
i just got it to kinda work with llama3.2 (ollama) (not really, just added retry functionality with some prompt engineering and hoped for the best)
i honestly doubt im gonna do anything with this since no real person really cares about this since this prob isn't gonna give real value even if actually worked on but if you do care, please contact me (im a 15 year old kid with noone to talk to, i just want other kids to talk to prob)
